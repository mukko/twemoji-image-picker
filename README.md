[Emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) is one of the most excellent invention since the dawn of history. It makes us to express our emotion visually and intuitively :heart_eyes:

I love to use emoji in my presentation slides. However, emoji provided by companies has licensing problems :tired_face: For example, App Store Review Guidelines by Apple prohibit developers from use Apple Color Emoji in applications. I keep in mind to avoid to use such emoji even in slides...

But never mind! We have [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) licensed under CC-BY 4.0! :clap:
